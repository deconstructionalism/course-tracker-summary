## Usage

### Get a Token

1. Run `npm run getToken`
2. In the window that pops up, select your account and allow access, then close
   the window once you are done. Your token is saved as `./token.json`. You will
   not need to re-authenticate using the browser again unless your token is
   invalidated.

### Construct Class Data

> Requires: token

1. Run `npm run constructClassData`. Class data will be saved in
   `./data/classData.json`.

### Construct Project Data

> Requires: token, class data

1. Run 
   `npm run constructClassData <path to project-eval-server projects folder>`.
   Class data in `./data/classData.json` will be updated with per-student
   completion information for each project.

### Generate an Email Template

> Requires: token, class data

1. Run `npm run generateEmailTemplate <template name>`. You can name your
   template anything you want. It will be saved as
   `./data/emailTemplates/<template name>.json`.

2. Edit the template file. You can edit the contents of following variables in
   the template:
   - `cc` - set carbon-copy recipients as an array of email strings
   - `subject`, `text` - within these functions, you can edit the contents of
      the text within back tics. This area allows interpolation of data values
      from the class data, and markdown. See generated template for values
      available for interpolation (_DATA DESCRIPTION_) and examples of
      interpolation.

### Send Emails

> Requires: token, class data, email template

1. Run `npm run sendEmails <template name>`. The template name must match a
   a template name in `./data/emailTemplates/` (without the `.js` extension).
2. A log of all email contents and send statuses will be saved in
  `./data/maulLogs`.

## Customize Student Data

You can customize which data is parsed from the course tracker by modifying the
logic within `bin/CourseTracker.js`. _More on this soon..._
